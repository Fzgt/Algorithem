// Given a function fn, return a memoized version of that function.

// A memoized function is a function that will never be called twice with the same inputs. 
// Instead it will return a cached value.

// You can assume there are 3 possible input functions: sum, fib, and factorial.

// sum accepts two integers a and b and returns a + b.
// fib accepts a single integer n and returns 1 if n <= 1 or fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) otherwise.
// factorial accepts a single integer n and returns 1 if n <= 1 or factorial(n - 1) * n otherwise.
 

// Example 1:

// Input:
// fnName = "sum"
// actions = ["call","call","getCallCount","call","getCallCount"]
// values = [[2,2],[2,2],[],[1,2],[]]
// Output: [4,4,1,3,2]
// Explanation:
// const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
// const memoizedSum = memoize(sum);
// memoizedSum(2, 2); // "call" - returns 4. sum() was called as (2, 2) was not seen before.
// memoizedSum(2, 2); // "call" - returns 4. However sum() was not called because the same inputs were seen before.
// // "getCallCount" - total call count: 1
// memoizedSum(1, 2); // "call" - returns 3. sum() was called as (1, 2) was not seen before.
// // "getCallCount" - total call count: 2
// Example 2:

// Input:
// fnName = "factorial"
// actions = ["call","call","call","getCallCount","call","getCallCount"]
// values = [[2],[3],[2],[],[3],[]]
// Output: [2,6,2,2,6,2]
// Explanation:
// const factorial = (n) => (n <= 1) ? 1 : (n * factorial(n - 1));
// const memoFactorial = memoize(factorial);
// memoFactorial(2); // "call" - returns 2.
// memoFactorial(3); // "call" - returns 6.
// memoFactorial(2); // "call" - returns 2. However factorial was not called because 2 was seen before.
// // "getCallCount" - total call count: 2
// memoFactorial(3); // "call" - returns 6. However factorial was not called because 3 was seen before.
// // "getCallCount" - total call count: 2
// Example 3:

// Input:
// fnName = "fib"
// actions = ["call","getCallCount"]
// values = [[5],[]]
// Output: [8,1]
// Explanation:
// fib(5) = 8 // "call"
// // "getCallCount" - total call count: 1



// 2870. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty

// You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers.
// There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array any number of times:
// Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
// Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
// Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or -1 if it is not possible.
 
// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [2,3,3,2,2,4,2,3,4]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: We can apply the following operations to make the array empty:
// - Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 3. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,2,4,2,3,4].
// - Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 2 and 4. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,4,3,4].
// - Apply the second operation on the elements at indices 0, 1, and 3. The resulting array is nums = [4,4].
// - Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 1. The resulting array is nums = [].
// It can be shown that we cannot make the array empty in less than 4 operations.
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [2,1,2,2,3,3]
// Output: -1
// Explanation: It is impossible to empty the array.
